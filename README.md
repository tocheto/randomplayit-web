This is work in progress!


This Web App allows you to listen to your music, stored on different Cloud storage providers.
You will not find any playlist, album arts,etc. The songs just pop up on your screen and you can select the one that you wish to 
listen to. Everything is random!

Currently supported storage providers : Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive, SoundCloud, 4Shared.
More coming up


Technical :
There is no server involved- everything is done by your browser, including storing the files and managing cloud authentication.
Thanks to Hello.JS it is possible!
